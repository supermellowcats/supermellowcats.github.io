Why Python for first time programmers
- readable
- fastest for prototyping
- fast enough for algebra, ML, deep learning (diss on C or Java freaks)
    - Numpy literally accesses the same low level implementations of algebra that C does
    - caveat: not fastest for abstractions such as Monte Carlo simulation and linear program optimization packages

Why Python for Data Science
- Vast toolkit
- Extremely rapid prototyping
- Vast ML, DL and AI community (more than R)
- Easier to deploy
    - Spark? other reasons
    - Writing your own package is easy - allows you to build proprietary for organizations that anybody can use
- Mature packages for working with web frameworks (Django) and HTTP (requests)
