Heckman on fragmentation within economics community: with Taber at the Bureau, ready to talk about returns to education. Half the room walked out - they just didn't think this could be measured.

What does it mean to be a centrist?

- the belief that the dominance of one or the other political (say) ideology leads to oppression of one side over the other
- the assumption that 'neither side is guiltless over long timeframes' (problematic), but that the dominant side is perhaps particularly problematic here and now
- a frustration with pervasive hypocrisy - ideologies and identities unite movements in support of leaders or policy that are rarely aligned with the original inflammatory stances often espoused to rally this support
- a largely pacifist, moderate endorsement of the pace of change at status quo

Things a centrist would say:
- "Can we engage with the here and now, looking to the past for unbiased evidence rather than inflammatory or reactive politics?""
- "Okay but how do we transcend to truly actionably transform the powers that be?"
- "History tells us that evil has no fixed religion or ideology"
- "I hate politics"
