"... there is much in Russia to make one pray that one's own country may achieve its goal not in that way. In part, perhaps, it is the fruit of some beastliness in the Russian nature - or in the Russian and Jewish natures when, as now, they are allied together. "
- John Maynard Keynes, from "Short View of Russia", 1925

Reminder that it is possible to be:
1. Very intelligent
2. Very successful
3. Very famous
4. Very influential
5. A skilled economist

AND complicit with bigotry. Of course, bigotry can always be explained away, especially by those who hero worship bigots for being, say, good economists.

"The evidence points to Keynes’ uncritical appropriation and reproduction of anti-Semitic clichés rather than inner deeper resentment of the Jews."[2]

Take a stand. Be better.

PS: Mr. Modi is a bigot without even being a competent economist.
