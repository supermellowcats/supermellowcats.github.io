## Quick summary:

- What I did:
    - engineered software (functionality and unit tests) for sociological triadic analysis using Python's NetworkX
- Things I learnt:
    - How to integrate clean, well-tested code into a massive codebase
    - How to think like an end-user in scoping and build new functionality
- When was this?
    - September 2019 through December 2019

This project was short, sweet, and self-explanatory. NetworkX is a powerful package that I have used extensively in the past, and it was rewarding to add my own contribution to it.
