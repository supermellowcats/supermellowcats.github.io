## Quick summary:

- What I did:
    - taught three algorithms (k-means clustering, PCA and t-SNE) to over 300 people
    - traveled to some amazing Python conferences
- Things I learnt:
    - how to deliver technical talks
    - the power of visualizations in developing intuition
    - unexpected use-cases for simple models
- When was this?
    - Between September 2018 and February 2019

In 2018 and 2019, I had the chance to speak at 3 Python conferences in 3 continents - in Johannesburg, Washington D.C., and Manipal, India.

Through multiple iterations of the talk, I learnt how to intuitively teach technical topics. The amazing culture of learning, sharing, and coding I saw at these conferences also made me a sworn fan of FOSS (Free Open Source Software). Props to the Python, PyCon and PyData communities at large for their steps taken for inclusiveness.

Resources for the coding walkthrough can be found [here](https://github.com/bakerwho/pca_pycon_talk). The idea behind the demo was to extract insights from the Netflix movie database - my own take on the popular Netflix Challenge from back in the day.
