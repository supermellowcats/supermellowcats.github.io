## MAP

- cheap hypotheses
- importance of failing fast
- EDA + data visualization
- Jupyter
- Consult with business leaders
- Communicate back
- Adapt fast to feedback

## START

Data science makes testing hypotheses cheap. At what scale these hypotheses operate, and what is done with the test results are what the Data Scientist must perform and inform.

Example of hypothesis at each scale

Failing fast is import WHY
- Case: well-defined business goal e.g. new recommendation/prediction feature that seems feasible
  - Have you tried the simple methods? Try to fail, if you do then complex method
  - Failure provokes discussion of institutional knowledge which gives insight into data patterns (wtf is a data pattern)
- Case:
