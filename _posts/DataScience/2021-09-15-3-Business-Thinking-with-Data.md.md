## MAP

- why do data scientists need business thinking?
- basics of business thinking
    - effective use of limited resources
    - project management (server load strategy)
    - customer-centric thinking (latency time concerns, only build good feature rule)
    - dollar value of time
    - effective scoping and successive contingency plans for data projects
- feasible/valuable sweet spot for projects
- innovating with data science: speed, accuracy, efficiency in new fields + examples like cancer, self-driving



## START

Data science without a return on investment cannot justify the high costs (more than just the salary) of hiring even a data scientist. This means that data scientists need to develop business thinking - a way of evaluating the time and dollar cost of a hypothetical project, as well as the time or dollar savings or value-add. This skillset is something frequently overlooked in the scramble of the technicalities of data engineering and data analysis (SQL, Python and so on). In this post, we will cover:
- the importance of **business thinking** and **autonomy** for successful data science
- business thinking frameworks for scoping and selecting a data science project
- the feasible-valuable sweet-spot for a data science project

One start-up I worked with eventually found themselves making the decision not to hire 'data scientists' until further notice. I was one of their first 'Data Science' specific hires, and was able work with some phenomenal teams working on machine learning/deep learning,  Data Engineering, and business intelligence. What was the problem here? The organization didn't have a clear value proposition for data science. While the Data Scientists they hired did good work, that work was in Data Engineering, ML, and BI - the organization realized that nobody was doing any actual data science! Their expectations from those roles were different - and better described by other titles. They have since opened more specific positions on those teams asking for Data Engineering, Signal Processing and Robotics skills. One hears along the grapevine that they still have their eyes open for a 'senior data scientist with a business background'.

This checks out. Their investment in data science lacked two ingredients for successful data science - **business thinking** and **autonomy**.

## The feasible-valuable sweet spot

Any proposed data science product needs to have two qualities - feasible, and valuble.

What is business thinking? A data science team needs to be able to translate business objectives into data science projects. This requires business thinking, something frequently tested using the 'business consulting case interview'.

Why autonomy? A data science team needs the freedom to combine insights from business leaders and data to scope and build the right data science products. This is a back-and-forth that requires data scientists to speak business lingo while operationalizing business goals using data. Business leaders alone frequently lack the technical know-how to gauge what is **feasible** - but they do have a strong intuition of what is **valuable**.

- Revenue minus cost
- Data science for cutting costs:
    - **speed**: do an existing thing faster, or do something that hasn't been done before because of speed constraints
    - **accuracy**: be right more often about micro- or macroscopic decisions, preferably in an automatable fashion
    - **efficiency**: use resources more optimally under constraints
- Data science for increased revenue: targeted advertising, adaptive pricing/discounting, conversion rates, data-driven strategy, product-market fit
