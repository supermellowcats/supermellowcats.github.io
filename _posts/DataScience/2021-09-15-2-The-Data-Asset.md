## MAP

- Data scientists operationalize a business problems using data
- Identify the data asset -> monetizing the data asset with a data science product
- $ value add for a project - data science team salary x project duration = ROI
- Who is the customer? DS2enduser, DS2businessleader, DS2team, DS2DS
- Applications of:
    - Decision Trees, regressions and other simple predictors/classifiers
    - Timeseries methods
    - Natural Language Processing
    - Clustering
    - Causal inference (hypothesis testing, A/B testing)

## START

On any day, the two most important questions any data scientist needs to be able to answer: "What is your Data Asset?" and "What is your Data Science Product?"

Definitions are in order.

**Data Asset**
The data itself. It could be a queryable SQL database, a data lake in the cloud, or a zipfile of CSVs (hopefully not!). It could be dynamically updating or static.

**Data Science Product**

The **Data Science Project/Project Team** are the project and team whose goal it is to build the Data Science Product.

While defining the Data Asset and Data Science Product in any use case, it is extremely helpful to think about the Customer of the eventual Product.

**Customer of a Data Science Product**
DS2enduser, DS2businessleader, DS2team, DS2DS
