## Quick summary:

- What I did:
    - Wrote a Master's Thesis titled "Common sense reasoning against algorithmic misinformation using Knowledge Graph Embeddings"
    - Led a rotating team of 6 people through multiple projects that culminated in this research design and experimental setup
    - Engineered a Python package [weboftruth](https://github.com/bakerwho/weboftruth) to train 11 KGE algorithms on any dataset with a single line of code
- Things I learnt:
    - How to use intuitive representation learning for better algorithmic performance
    - How to build a production-ready deep representation learning pipeline using Python and Torch
    - How to write software for deep learning hardware (cuda, GPUs) etc.
- When was this?
    - The latter 15 months of my time at UChicago, so May 2020 through September 2021

All code is available at the [weboftruth](https://github.com/bakerwho/weboftruth) repo. Just `python -m pip install git+https://github.com/weboftruth/` to use it.

I also have Jupyter notebooks (accessible via Google Colab) that walk you through the codebase so you can run it yourself.
