For the [sexiest job of the 21st century](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century), there sure is a lot of confusion about what it means to be a Data Scientist. In my new blog series, I unpack this question with valuable thinking tools for anybody who aspires to learn, do, or hire Data Science.

Here's a conceptual itinerary:

1. What is Data Science and do you need it?
    a. Who is a Data Scientist?
    b. Should you be hiring data scientists?
    c. Are you hiring data scientists?
2. The Data Asset and the Data Science Product
    - Data scientists operationalize a business problems using data
    - Identify the data asset -> monetizing the data asset with a data science product
    - $ value add for a project - data science team salary x project duration = ROI
    - Who is the customer? DS2enduser, DS2businessleader, DS2team, DS2DS
    - Applications of:
        - Decision Trees, regressions and other simple predictors/classifiers
        - Timeseries methods
        - Natural Language Processing
        - Clustering
        - Causal inference (hypothesis testing, A/B testing)
3. Algorithm Browser - matching algorithms to business problems
    - Clustering: market segmentation, category identification
    - Decision tree: recommendations
    - Natural Language Processing: text search + recommendations, turning words (phone calls, interview recordings, comments, complaints) into a data asset
    - Timeseries: forecasting, curve-fitting
    - Deep representation learning
4. Demonstrating the value of data science - case studies
    - Self-driving car delivery service - optimization
    - Automatic discount at chain store - weekly email
    - Natural Language asset - comment/complaint/review aggregator building a B2B intelligence service
5. Working at scale - from linear regression and decision trees in a Jupyter notebook to serving 1000s of request per day

For the sexiest job of the 21st century, there's a lot of confusion about what a Data Scientist really does. This is confusing for people trying to be Data Scientists. What skills should you develop? What machine learning algorithms should you learn? What software engineering tools and frameworks should you learn? What projects should you take on? But importantly, even once you have these skills and experience, how should you think like a data scientist? Read on to find out.

Data Science is a vast and complicated beast - it is the art of solving problems by matching imperfect data with imperfect algorithms.

## Job-hunters: What excites you about Data Science?

Do you need to hire a Data Analyst or a Data Scientist? Or are you more in need of a Data Engineer? If your data practice is mature, you may even be in need of a Machine Learning Engineer instead?

## Recruiters: How can Data Science solve business problems at your organization?
