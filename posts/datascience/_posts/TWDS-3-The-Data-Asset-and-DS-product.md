## MAP

- Data scientists operationalize a business problems using data
- Identify the data asset -> monetizing the data asset with a data science product
- $ value add for a project - data science team salary x project duration = ROI
- Who is the customer? DS2enduser, DS2businessleader, DS2team, DS2DS
- Applications of:
    - Decision Trees, regressions and other simple predictors/classifiers
    - Timeseries methods
    - Natural Language Processing
    - Clustering
    - Causal inference (hypothesis testing, A/B testing)
- Intelligent contact center
    - Enhance your customer service experience and reduce costs by integrating machine learning into your contact center.

- Personalization
    - Improve customer engagement and conversion by creating personalized web experiencesâ€”tailored to individual customer preferences and behaviors across channels.
- Intelligent document processing
    - Instantly extract text and data from virtually any document such as loan applications and medical forms without manual effort.
- Intelligent search
    - Boost business productivity and customer satisfaction by delivering accurate and useful information faster from siloed and unstructured information sources across the organization.
- Fraud detection
    - Improve profitability by automating the detection of potentially fraudulent online activity, such as payment fraud and fake accounts, using machine learning and your own unique data.
- Media intelligence
    - Maximize the value of media content by adding machine learning to media workflows such as search and discovery, content localization, compliance, monetization, and more.
- Business forecasting
    - Accurately predict demand forecasting and streamline supply-demand decision to combine historical time series data with additional variables such as product features, pricing, and holidays.

## START

On any day, the two most important questions any data scientist needs to be able to answer: "What is your Data Asset?" and "What is your Data Science Product?"

Definitions are in order.

**Data Asset**
The data itself. It could be a queryable SQL database, a data lake in the cloud, or a zipfile of CSVs (hopefully not!). It could be dynamically updating or static.

**Data Science Product**

The **Data Science Project/Project Team** are the project and team whose goal it is to build the Data Science Product.

While defining the Data Asset and Data Science Product in any use case, it is extremely helpful to think about the Customer of the eventual Product.

**Customer of a Data Science Product**
DS2enduser, DS2businessleader, DS2team, DS2DS
