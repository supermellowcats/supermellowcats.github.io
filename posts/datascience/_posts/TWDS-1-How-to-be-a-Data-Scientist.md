## MAP

- Too many skills to learn - which to prioritize
- Different types of jobs that Data Scientist does (with help)
- Skill-role map
- How to identify strengths/interests

## START

Aspiring data scientists are pushed to acquire a range of skills at breakneck pace with little room for reflection. A long but my no means exhaustive list is below:
- Programming (usually Python or R)
- Probability and Statistics
- Data Extraction, Cleaning and Analysis
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning & AI
- Data visualization and dashboarding tools (like Plot.ly, ggplot, matplotlib)
- Jupyter notebooks and other tools for rapid prototyping (like Databricks or Magellan)
- Cloud technologies (including the host of sub-services offered by giants like Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure)
- Software engineering tools and best practices (like Github, VCS, Docker)
- MLOps tools and best practices (like Airflow)

Other under-rated skills that data scientists **aren't commonly directed to acquire, but should**:
- Project management strategies and tools (like Jira or Trello)
- 

In this post, I will map these skills to sub-projects within Data Science. If you're a current or aspiring data scientist, this will help you figure out your strengths and interests in the field, and how to pursue them.


Data Science in practice can take on a number of different forms, characterized by factors like use case, technology stack, algorithm, or dataset. If you're on the other side of the interview table hiring data scientists, it will help you identify if Data Science has value in your business context.

Companies, especially young ones, sometimes hire data scientists without a clear understanding of what data science can do for them, what kind of data science role to hire, and how to evaluate a great fit. This exposes them to risk at the bleeding edge of a field that has vast, demonstrable value. On the other hand, the data scientists working at these places are likely to be underutilized and unfulfilled. Avoid ever facing this problem by reading on.

### What is Data Science anyway?

a. Who is a Data Scientist?
- Untangling concepts: Data Analysis, Data Science, Machine Learning, AI, Deep Learning
- Which one does a Data Scientist do? Any number of them - it depends on the project and business needs

b. Should you be hiring data scientists? Read this
- Does your business have data? Then it likely has data use cases. Are you looking to build them? That's a business question - it isn't always feasible
- You may need someone senior (can you afford it) or someone junior with the right skills (v important are business sense and communication)
- Already have a project in mind? Are you sure it's feasible? Sometimes it takes data skills to know for sure
- Quiz to know if you should hire a data scientist:
    - Lots of data but no data-driven decision making? Yes
        - Many industries automatically qualify: e-commerce
    - For example, if you have search, recommendations, advertising - make it better
    - Need intelligent decision making at some scale? What scale? Have specific question in mind? Have data that can answer question?

c. Are you hiring data scientists? Read this

A multiplicity of roles involve Data Science - like 'Data Analyst', 'Business Analyst', 'Applied Scientist', 'Data Engineer', 'Machine Learning Engineer', 'Deep Learning Engineer', not to mention 'Data Scientist'. What's the difference? What position should you hire for? How should you evaluate them? Read on to find out.

>> TODO: change the following

## Question 1: How mature is the data practice?

## Question 2: What type of technical data skills are needed?

### Question 2a: Do they need somebody to build software systems to reliably store, update and access data? -> Data Engineer

### Question 2b: Do they need somebody to access data and write code to generate visualizations, KPIs/metrics, and dashboards - often in consultation with business leaders who lack the requisite technical skills? -> Business Intelligence Analyst/Business Analyst

### Question 2c: Do they need someone to extract insight from data with specific end goals, such as to advise strategy, expand to a new market, develop a new product/feature? -> Data Analyst

### Question 2d: Do they need to automate decision-making using data, perhaps using cutting-edge methods? -> Machine Learning Scientist

### Question 2e: Do they need to build and deploy machine learning models at scale? -> Machine Learning Engineer

### Question 2f: Do they need someone who can identify data projects with demonstrable business value and work a combination of the roles described (often with support) to build those projects?


# So which one are you?

Typical salaries + resources to check

A company can only pay you as much value as you bring to the company (in practice a fraction of that)
