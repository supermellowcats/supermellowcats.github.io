My name is Aabir Abubaker Kar.

I graduated in August 2021 with an [MA in Computational Social Science](https://macss.uchicago.edu/) at **The University of Chicago**.

I am currently on the hunt for exciting Data Science positions that let me combine my extensive algorithmic repertoire, compulsive problem-solving attitude, and gritty, extreme-ownership working style. Get in touch at [aabir.abubaker.kar at gmail dot com](mailto:aabir.abubaker.kar at gmail dot com) if you want to work with me!

I was most recently a researcher [The Knowledge Lab](https://www.knowledgelab.org/) where was studying how machine learning models respond to deliberately corrupted data - helping us understand the effect of disinformation on machine learning and AI. This was the crux of my Master's thesis, titled "Common sense reasoning against algorithmic misinformation using Knowledge Graph Embeddings".

Since 2017, I have worked as a data scientist, researcher, business analyst, or some combination of these at some phenomenal places - [Zipline](https://flyzipline.com/) (San Francisco, USA), the [International Centre for Theoretical Sciences, Bangalore](https://www.icts.res.in/) (Bengaluru, India), and the [New England Complex Systems Institute](http://necsi.edu/) (Cambridge, USA).

I also hold a **BE in Engineering** and an **MSc in Physics** from BITS Pilani, Goa Campus in India. I opted into my Master's in Science as a 'reverse dualite' - an uncommon decision in India where everyone is obsessed with becoming an Engineer. I also hold from BITS a Minor Certificate in Philosophy, Economics and Politics.

[Here](https://bakerwho.github.io/projects/) are some of my projects.

My research interests are in the intersection of AI and society - including political polarization, bias in news media, and the structure of knowledge bases. As a social scientist, I'm also deeply interested in theories of knowledge, learning, and cognition.
