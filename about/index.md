My name is Aabir Abubaker Kar.

I have worked as a data scientist and engineer, machine learning researcher, business analyst, or some combination of these at some phenomenal places:
- [Brighthive.io](https://brighthive.io/) (Chicago, USA)
- [The Knowledge Lab](https://www.knowledgelab.org/) and the [Computer Science Department](https://computerscience.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago
- [Zipline](https://flyzipline.com/) (San Francisco, USA)
- [International Centre for Theoretical Sciences, Bangalore](https://www.icts.res.in/) (Bengaluru, India)
- [New England Complex Systems Institute](http://necsi.edu/) (Cambridge, USA)

[Here](https://bakerwho.github.io/projects/) are some of my projects.

I am currently on the hunt for exciting Data Science positions that let me combine my extensive algorithmic repertoire, compulsive problem-solving attitude, and gritty, extreme-ownership working style. Get in touch at [aabir.abubaker.kar at gmail dot com](mailto:aabir.abubaker.kar at gmail dot com) if you want to work with me!

## Background

I graduated in August 2021 with an [MA in Computational Social Science](https://macss.uchicago.edu/) at **The University of Chicago**.

During graduate school, I was a Machine Learning Researcher at [The Knowledge Lab](https://www.knowledgelab.org/), investigating how deep learning models respond to deliberately corrupted data. This was the crux of my Master's thesis, titled "Common sense reasoning against algorithmic misinformation using Knowledge Graph Embeddings". Reach out for a copy!

My undergraduate education includes a surprising add-on Master's. I hold a **BE in Engineering** and an **MSc in Physics** from BITS Pilani, Goa Campus in India. I also hold from BITS a Minor Certificate in Philosophy, Economics and Politics.

My research interests are in the intersection of AI and society - including political polarization, bias in news media, and the structure of knowledge bases. As a social scientist, I'm also deeply interested in theories of knowledge, learning, and cognition.
